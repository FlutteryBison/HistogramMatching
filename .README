Quick implimentation of histogram matching.

In image processing, histogram matching is the transformation of an image so that its histogram matches a specified histogram

In this implementation the specified histogram is that of a target image.

It was a quick implementation for the purpose of exam revision so is not at all optimised.

To run
put the target image in the target folder
put input images in the inputs folder 
run the script hist_match.m
